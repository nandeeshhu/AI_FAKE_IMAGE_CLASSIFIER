## Project Title: AI Image Classifier

### Overview:
The AI Image Classifier project aims to classify images into two categories: real and AI-generated (fake). It involves collecting a large dataset, training a deep learning model, and evaluating its performance in distinguishing between real and fake images.

### Data Collection:
1. **Collection Method:** Images were collected using a web scraping technique from Google Images.
2. **Dataset Size:** The dataset consists of 100,000 images, with approximately 2,000 images per category (real and AI-generated).
3. **Categories:** The dataset includes images from various domains, such as animals, humans, nature, and objects.
4. **Image Processing:** Images were resized to 300x300 pixels to ensure uniformity and reduce computational complexity during training.

### Model Architecture:
1. **Architecture:** The model architecture used is based on AlexNet, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for image classification tasks.
2. **Layers:** The AlexNet architecture consists of five convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers.
3. **Activation Function:** ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions are used between layers to introduce non-linearity.
4. **Output Layer:** The output layer consists of a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function, producing binary classification predictions (real or fake).

### Training and Evaluation:
1. **Training Dataset:** The dataset was split into training (90%), validation (5%), and test (5%) sets using random sampling.
2. **Training Method:** The model was trained using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a binary cross-entropy loss function.
3. **Hyperparameters:** Training was conducted over 20 epochs with a learning rate of 0.01 and a step size of 5.
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics on the test set.
5. **Results:** The trained model achieved an accuracy of 99.53%, with a precision of 99.06%, recall of 100%, and an F1-score of 99.53%.

### Conclusion:
The AI Image Classifier project successfully demonstrates the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images with high accuracy. The use of a large, diverse dataset and a robust deep learning model architecture contributes to the model's effectiveness in real-world applications such as detecting fake images and combating misinformation.
